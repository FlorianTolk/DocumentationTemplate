Version format is #.#.#
Version updating #.#.X is minor, non breaking changes
Version updating #.X.# is major, potentially breaking changes
Version updating X.#.# is a new version change of the project.
### Detailed Summary
What Software Trouble Reports(STR) or GitHub Issues are being addressed
What additional functionality are being made
What services are being changed (if multiple services are being used, Github automatically trackes what files aree being changed)

*The following do not need to be included in the README, but aims to detail how code should be documented*
## Code Documentation
The first line(s) of each file should be a comment clearly stating the purpose of the file
Each function should include a comment clearly stating its purpose within the file
